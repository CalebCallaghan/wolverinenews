On Sept. 20 the Township of Wellington North received approval for a 100kW solar panel rooftop installation at the Mount Forest and District Sports Complex. Arntjen Solar, the service provider, informed the township that of 42 applications submitted, Wellington North’s is one of only six approved.
Under the Feed in Tariff or FiT5.0 program, there is no cost to the municipality and Wellington North has no financial obligation toward the installation of the solar panels. Arntjen Solar will cover 100 per cent of the cost. Wellington North will sign a 20-year equipment lease agreement, where wellington will only get 5% of the revenue generated. As part of the deal, the Township of Wellington North has advised Arntjen Solar and Wellington North Power that they want to look into net-metering. Under Ontario’s net-metering program, customers who generate on-site energy for their own use can receive bill credits for any surplus energy sent into the grid. Hopefully this will make it reduce energy costs at the sports complex, and other potential locations, while receiving the benefit of being connected to the grid. Arntjen Solar have also expressed interest in working with the township to submit an application under the microFiT Program before Dec. 31, 2017. The program allows municipal government, educational and health-care facilities to develop a “micro” renewable electricity project, 10 kilowatts or less in size, on their property. Excluding the potential impact of net-metering, the revenue potential for Wellington North is up to $100,000 with no financial cost. If council chooses to invest in the program, Wellington North's revenue would be increased accordingly.

“If we wanted to invest the capital ... with rates as they are, you are looking at a five to seven-year period to cover your capital cost, the rest is typically seen as your revenue portion, but, this is a low-risk opportunity, we think it’s worth exploring," said CAO Mike Givens. “We’ve also had some conversations as it relates to the idea of net-metering, which I am very intrigued by, especially for a heavy user like our sports complex in Mount Forest. Outside wastewater treatment plants, they are our heaviest user of electricity, so if we can find a way to offset some of those costs by producing some of our own power I think that is a great opportunity as well.”
